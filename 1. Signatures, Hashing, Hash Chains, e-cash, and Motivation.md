## Origin of Money

- Stored Receipts Theory
## Why is Money Valuable ?
Because we collectively agree it has value thus can be used as a means of exchange.
## Traditional Payments
PartyA ---> Trusted Institution ----> PartyB
## Digital Payments
1. Simple E-Cash
2. Chaumian E-Cash

## Primitives for Making a Cryptocurrency

1. Hash Functions 
- hash(data) -> output
- "Avalanche Effect" - change 1 bit of the input, about half the output should change
### What Hash Funcs shouldn't do
. preimage resistance
given y you can't find any x such that hash(x) == y
. 2nd preimage resistance
given x, y, such that hash(x)  == y, you can't find x where x' != x and hash(x') == y
. collision resistance 
nobody can find any x, z such that x != z ; hash(x) == hash(z)

2. Signaturees
- Signatures are useful! Messages from someone. 3 funcs needed:
.GenerateKeys()
.sign(secretKey, message)
.Verify(publicKey, message, signature)

## Signatures From Hashes
- First step is to implement a signature system using hashes only
- this is called 'Lamport Signatures'
